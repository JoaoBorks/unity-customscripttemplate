# Unity Custom Script Template
A simple tool to create your own script template.

## What's this about?
This tool adds another Script Template to Unity that will serve as an alternative for the default "C# Script" that I personally always
modify before writing my scripts. In essence, it adds a signature header on every script with your name, email and creation date. Also,
it removes the `Start()` and `Update()` methods from the default template.
